It is a recommended practice to apply the security updates on the system in periodic intervals.

Write a playbook /home/thor/playbooks/patch_system.yml to ensure servers listed on /home/thor/playbooks/inventory are up to date with periodic security updates.

In CentOS, ensure the playboook installs and configures the yum-cron package to fit the need.
Confiure the yum-cron config file: /etc/yum/yum-cron.conf as update_cmd = security, to auto-update security packages and ensure yum-cron service is restarted afterwards.
