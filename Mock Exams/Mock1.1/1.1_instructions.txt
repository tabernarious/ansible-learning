Add an entry for node00 in ~/playbooks/inventory file. IP address of node00 host is 172.20.1.100 and SSH user and password is root and Passw0rd. We have a list of users in ~/playbooks/data/users.yml file. There are two groups in there admins and developers which have list of different users. Create a playbook ~/playbooks/add_users.yml to perform below given tasks on node00 node:

a. Add all users given in users.yml on node00.

b. Make sure home directory for all users under developers group is /var/www and for admins it should be default.

c. Set password d3v3l0p3r for all users under developers group and adm$n$ for users under admins group. Make sure to use Ansible vault to encrypt the passwords, use ~/playbooks/secrets/vault.txt file as vault secret file.

d. All users under admins group must be added as sudo user, for that simply make them member of wheel group on node00
