# Learning Ansible
This repo is all about my journey learning Ansible.

I started with Kode Kloud, a great resource for hands-on practice. I did the DevOps course, Ansible for Beginners, and then the Ansible Certification Prep Course. Kode Kloud is not polished, but the lab exercises have *validation scripts*, so you get immediate feedback on whether you met the objectives. This is great for getting started with Ansible.

After I completed the Kode Kloud courses and mock exams, I moved on to Linux Academy Ansible Certification Prep Course. Linux Academy is more mature than Kode Kloud, but virtually none of the lab exercises are validated (I can think of one). This means you have to do all of the validation yourself by watching the Ansible output, logging into servers to check for content, package states, and service states etc. It is a different style and is valuable, but was less engaging for when I was getting started.
