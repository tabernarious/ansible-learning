# Throttle
# The throttle keyword limits the number of workers for a particular task. It can be set at the block and task level. Use throttle to restrict tasks that may be CPU-intensive or interact with a rate-limiting API.

# Throttle setting is capped by the forks and serial settings.

# Allow only one fork to work on this task at a time.
