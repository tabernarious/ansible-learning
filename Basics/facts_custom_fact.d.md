# Custom Facts
On target host machines (not the Ansible Controller):
* Create ```/etc/ansible/facts.d``` directory, even if Ansible is not installed on the host (doesn't need to be).
* Create files with ```.fact``` extension to be gathered by the Ansible Controller.

Fact files can be INI, JSON, or an executable that returns JSON.

host1:/etc/ansible/facts.d/software_inv.fact

    [software]
    adobe=installed
    dreamweaver=uninstalled
    office=installed

host1:/etc/ansible/facts.d/data.fact

    [location]
    floor=1
    room=325
