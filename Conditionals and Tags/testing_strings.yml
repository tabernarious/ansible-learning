    #By default, regex works like search, but regex can be configured to perform other tests as well, by passing the match_type keyword argument. In particular, match_type determines the re method that gets used to perform the search. The full list can be found in the relevant Python documentation here.

#All of the string tests also take optional ignorecase and multiline arguments. These correspond to re.I and re.M from Pythonâ€™s re library, respectively.
